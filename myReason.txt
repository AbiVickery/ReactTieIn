For the beginning of the time we had for this project, i spent more time then i should have on the database part. it was mainly typing down the names of ponies to be used in the database. At around week 2 1/2, i decided to do the html/css part before it got too late. I got confused down the road and made too many html and css files as well as each page having its own js file. I tried to make it all connect with the react but i got confused and i just couldnt bring myself to ask for help, no matter how badly i wanted to. Ive always had so much difficulty asking for help my whole life. And within this week, ive been having a lot more anxiety and been much more stressed than usual. I tried my hardest to finish the project and to push through it all. I am ready to accept the fact that i will most likely not graduate this class. I'm sorry.
